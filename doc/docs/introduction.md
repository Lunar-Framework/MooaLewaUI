# Introduction

> **Status**: ðŸš§ Initial iteration (features and structure subject to frequent changes)

Lunar is a modular game core library based on **ECS architecture**, written in **pure C#**, and **engine-agnostic**.
This repository contains only the public core code and does not depend on Unity or any other game engine.

Lunar is developed based on [Arch-ECS](https://github.com/genaray/Arch). The license for Arch-ECS can be found [here](Licenses/Apache-2.0/LICENSE.MD).

This README is temporary.

## License
Lunar is available under a dual-license model:

### Open Source License (LGPL-3.0)
- You may use Lunar in closed-source projects as long as you do not modify Lunarâ€™s source code.
- If you modify Lunar (e.g. add/change core modules), you must release those modifications under the same license (LGPL-3.0).
- Your own game/application code may remain closed-source.

### Commercial License
- If you wish to modify Lunar and keep those modifications closed-source, or include Lunar in a project where LGPL is not acceptable, you can contact me for a commercial license.
